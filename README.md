# ConvertXpert

This library is being developed in order to create a universal converter for all the most popular file formats.
2 people are engaged in the development, the project is created with full enthusiasm.
The goal of the project is to create a free converter for everyone, we plan to develop a library first, and only then a full-fledged application based on it.
I hope my friend and I will not abandon this project. :)
